    <h2> PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND COMPUTINGAND COMPUTING</h2>

    <p> Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) is a privately funded not-for-profit
        educational initiative started by President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, andZia Khan to help
        promote education, research and business opportunities in emerging techfields like</p>

    </ul>





    <h3 id="cnc">Cloud Native computing:</h3>

    <p> The <strong>Cloud Native Computing</strong> program prepares the students to program in open sourcetechnologies
        like, <strong><em>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native</em></strong> while
        introducing the students to development of Microservices and software developmenttechniques on cloud platforms
        like AWS.</p>

    <h3 id="ai">Artificial Intelligence:</h3>

    <p> The <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the
        AItechnology, via teaching programming in open source languages like <strong><em>Python, Numpy,
                Pandas,Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask</em></strong>, and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use
        cases, andending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.</p>

    <h3 id="bcn">Blockchain:</h3>

    <p>The main emphasis of <strong>Blockchain</strong> program is to understand the blockchains like
        <strong><em>Ethereum and Hyperledger (Fabric)</em></strong>, and learn to program in languages such as Solidity,
        JavaScript onframeworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed
        Apps(DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS)
        and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.</p>

    <h3 id="iot">Internet of Things:</h3>

    The <strong>Internet of things</strong> program introduces the students to open source development technologies like
    <strong><em>Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant</em></strong>,and Kubernetes while
    making them efficient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoTCloud, and voice computing for device control.
